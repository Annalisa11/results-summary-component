## üìñ Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

### Screenshot

![Mobile Design](./src/design/my-mobile-design.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## ‚öíÔ∏è My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS with superpowers
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Types for JavaScript

### What I learned

As it was my first time using SCSS in a project, I learned about the power of css variables and mixins.

```scss
@mixin panel-color($color) {
  background-color: rgba($color, 0.06);
  color: $color;
}

.blue {
  @include panel-color($primary-blue);
}
```

```tsx
<div className={`panel ${color}`}>
```
